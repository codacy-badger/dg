You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```scss
// Set a variable to run the if statement against
$boolean: true !default

=simple-mixin
  @if $boolean
    @debug "$boolean is #{$boolean}"
    display: block
  @else
    @debug "$boolean is #{$boolean}"
    display: none

.some-selector
  +simple-mixin
```
