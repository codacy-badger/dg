# Dylan Gattey

I'm redesigning my site to be a lightweight, mobile-friendly, up to date exhibition of my projects and experiments rather than be the same slow, non-customizable Wordpress grid it's been for years. Currently very much a work in progress, but I'm having fun and teaching myself how to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in the process! It's meant to be a simpler version of the site with much of the same content, but updated for 2k16 instead of 2013 (when I last did anything significant design-wise on my site). Cleaner, sparser layout with larger, clearer font + more professional images, an updated logo, and more of my own voice in the writing.

### Development
Coming soon.

### Status
There are lots of todos left. There's a public Trello board with my progress and ideas at https://trello.com/b/MJdtje7y/dylangattey-com. Working on finalizing the design for project grid, and starting to do the project detail pages.
